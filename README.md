# This is the data for my blog

Was tired of wordpress, hence github pages with Jekyll.
Blog like a hacker my friend. :)

# Architect theme

I am using the Architect theme written by [pietromenna][5].
This is a [Jekyll][1] theme that is an adaptation of [@jasonlong][2]'s [Architect theme][4] on [GitHub Pages][3].
