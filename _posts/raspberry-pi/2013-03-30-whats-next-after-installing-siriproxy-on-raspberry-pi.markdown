I followed [DarkTherapy's](http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=31766) guide to install [wiringPi](https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/) on my Rpi!

[Here's the guide that I've followed](http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=63&t=25118&p=231345).

Changed some of the codes inside, which is fairly straightforward.

So here's the video of it! :)

Next up, I'll hook it up to a relay and toggle the lights! :D

Do post in the comments if you guys would like to have a step by step guide on installing the [wiringPi](https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/) on the Rpi.
