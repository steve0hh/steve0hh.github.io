So I've seen this video:

**EEVblog #180 - Soldering Tutorial Part 1 - Tools**

Hence, decided to take a few notes about it:


## Choice of solder

**Solder should have lead inside **

Leadfree solder is harder to control

**Gauge of solder should be < 0.5mm (0.46mm would be good)**

The higher the gauge of solder wire, the harder to control the amount soldered.
It'll also take a longer time to melt.

The material inside the solder matters:

60sn/40pb
63sn/37pb (recommended) - melting point at same temperature

### What does sn/pb/ag means?

- sn = tin
- pb = lead
- ag = silver

**Solder should have flux inside**

The flux cleans the copper part of the circuit board making it easier for the solder to adhere to the board.
