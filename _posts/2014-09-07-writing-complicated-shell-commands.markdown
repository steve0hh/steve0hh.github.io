Helloworld! :)

Just wanted to post a tip that I've found very useful!

## Prerequisite

You must have $EDITOR enviroment variable set in your bashrc/zsh

You can do so by adding the following line in your `.bashrc`

    export EDITOR=editor

So for me, I would like to use [vim](http://www.vim.org/) as my editor, I would do

    export EDITOR=vim

## While editing some frigging long bash command

You just hit `CTRL-x-e`.

It'll open your set `$EDITOR` for you and you just edit the command inside it.

After which you just save and esc.

It'll automatically add the command to your terminal.

Hope you guys found something helpful here.
:)
