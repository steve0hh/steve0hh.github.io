Hello world!

I've found another great thing that can be used with jekyll!

I've always wondered how can we integrate a form without the use of PHP or server side softwares.

After [reading around](http://sebastien.saunier.me/blog/2014/04/15/you-do-not-need-a-database-for-your-contact-form.html),
I found this great service (<s>http://forms.brace.io/</s>) that allows you to add a form to your jekyll site without the need of server side
languages.

It's a pretty neat service and it's free for the first 1000 submissions per email.

Guess I'll be using that next time.... :)

##Update - 26-Aug-2015

Forms weren't working hence headed to brace.io and saw their [blogpost](http://blog.brace.io/2015/01/26/goodbye/) regarding them joining space.
*But fear not!* It has been ported over to [assembly](http://assembly.com/formspree) and will remain to run as a free service!

And the following is the link: [formspree](http://formspree.io/)
