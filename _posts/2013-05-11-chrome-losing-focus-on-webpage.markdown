For those that uses [vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en), have you always encountered a time where the focus is lost and not on the webpage and will render every shortcut in viumium useless?

I always used to hate that as I didn't wanted to move my hands to my mouse and always trying to hit the `tab` button and hopefully the focus would magically appear.

Well! There's a workaround for that! :)

To open your search engines settings, type the following in your URL bar in chrome.

    chrome://settings/searchEngines

Then add a entry to it under the `Other search engines`, scroll to the bottom, you should see 3 empty fields like the second image below.

Now, add the shortcut!

Under the field `Add a new search engine`, input something like "Focus on webpage" or something.

Then for the keyword, add the preferred shortcut for your choice to trigger it to make your computer focus on the page.

My preference is

    f


Then in the `URL with %s in place` field, add:

    javascript:

It should look something like the image below.

Then hit the `Return` key.

So after adding, the settings panel will look like this.

Then hit the `done` button! :)

##How to use it?

So there comes to a scenario, where the focus is not on the page!

So most likely I'll have to hit the `tab` key a few times before I get my focus on the webpage and be able to use my [vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en) shortcuts.

Now, time to demostrate the workaround! :)

Hit `CMD + L` for mac users or `CTRL+L` for windows user.

Then hit the shortcut u added for the second field, mine was `f`

Then hit the `Return` key!

There! Focused back on the page! [Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en) FTW! :)
