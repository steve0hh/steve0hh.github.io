Hi guys.

It's bee a while since I last updated my blog. This is because I had LASIK done on my eyes! :)

So yeah. I am here to share my experience with you guys in case you are a programmer and was wondering if LASIK would affect your work.

The LASIK procedure I had done to my eyes is called IntraLase wavefront LASIK.

It basically uses a laser to create the flap in your cornea. Then the surgeon will lift the flap and then laser and shape your cornea to the correct shape.

Below is the timeline that I'll be updating for the whole journey of my LASIK.

**Note: This is not a sponsered post. I just want to share my lasik expirence. :) **

##Warning! Long post ahead..

##Pre-LASIK assessment

For the record, I did 4 Pre-LASIK assessment and below were the results

###First pre-LASIK assessment @ Tan Tock Seng Hospital

Pre-LASIK assessment for Standard LASIK.

The doctor actually told me I had some irregularities in my cornea and told me to come back for another assessment a week later.(Free of charge)

Was initially worried about it and I thought it was something wrong with my right eye. Hence I slept on my left eye. That was a stupid mistake.

###Second pre-LASIK assessment @ Tan Tock Seng Hospital

The doctor actually said the irregularities in my left eye actually grew bigger. Nevertheless I was pretty sad due to the fact that I've been wanting to do LASIK for the past 2 years. Didn't ask much and went home.

After a few days, it occurred to me that I slept on my eyes the whole night before the assessment.

###Third pre-LASIK assessment @ ClearVision clinic

Pre-LASIK assessment for Epi-LASIK

2 months after the second assessment, I decided to try my luck again. Due to the fact that the assessment at ClearVision Clinic costs only $5. This

Miraculously, they told me my eyes were pretty normal and I was given the green light for Epi-lasik.

Asked the doctor regarding my previous eye test at TTSH, he told me his results here was good and does not have any concerns with me proceeding with LASIK.

I went home a very confused man.

On one hand, I was very excited to do LASIK and would love to proceed with it straight away!

On the other hand, I was very worried about my results as they were so inconsistent!

###Forth and final pre-LASIK assessment @ Shinagawa Eye Center

Decided to book another assessment to double confirm that my eyes are suitable for LASIK.

This time, the assessment I went for is for the IntraLase WaveFront Procedure.

After the assessment, the doctor(Dr Lee) also said my eyes are suitable for LASIK.

After which, I asked him why were my results so inconsistent and he told me that there are many factors that would affect the assessment.

Hence I asked if sleeping on my eye would affect the results and he said yes, even rubbing of your eyes will affect the cornea shape.

After much consideration, I've decided to go ahead with the procedure. :)

##Deciding on which procedure I should do.

[Standard LASIK](http://www.shinagawa.com.sg/en/lasik-services/procedures-available/standard-lasik)

[Epi-LASIK](http://www.shinagawa.com.sg/en/lasik-services/procedures-available/epi-lasik)

[IntraLase wavefront lasik with cross-linking(Lasik Xtra)](http://www.shinagawa.com.sg/en/lasik-services/lasik-xtra)

I finally decided with IntraLase WaveFront Lasik with cross-linking(In other words(Lasik Xtra).
I've added cross-linking to my procedure as I want a peace of mind that I am doing the safest and best possible option for my eyes.

Like what they said. **Do it once with the best possible option**.

##LASIK process (12 May 2014)

My appointment was at 0930 hrs in the morning. Couldn't sleep the night before as I was too nervous for the procedure.

Went in to the clinic and after some registration and signing of papers, I was led to a room and was given a mild sedative which they said will help me relax a little.

After which I was administered some numbing eye drops for a couple of times over a period. (couldn't remember how long) haha.

Then I was led to a room and waited for Dr Lee to come along.
He did some finally checking of my eyes to ensure that they are OK to proceed with the procedure.

###Cutting of the flap
I was led to the room in which I was told to sit on something that looks like a dentist chair. Then Dr Lee told me to open my eye wide. Then he used a suction thing to suck my eye.

After which, I was told to look at the white light for about 7 seconds and it was done.

Then the other eye was the exact same thing.

By this time, vision is blurry but I could still look around and no. I **did not** feel any pain at all.

Then I rested there for about 10 minutes.

###LASIK time

After resting, they led me to another room.

This time, it was for the actual lasik process! :)

Dr Lee was very professional and patient. Told me not to worry and he's going to start the lasik.

There was this sticker thing which he stick to my eyelid so that I could not blink. (He then moisturised my cornea with a cotton wool like thing)

Then he lifted up my flap(temporary loss of vision) and started with the laser.

You could smell burnt tissues as they are doing the lasik. Pretty similar to when you burn your hair. :p

During the whole time, they were counting down 15 seconds. Once it was 15 seconds. You are done.

###Cross linking

Dr Lee actually proceeded with the cross-linking with the eye that had the procedure just done. (Think because the flap is already lifted)

He then added a yellow solution to my eye.

Then there was this machine that was shining some light in which he told me to fixate at for 15 seconds or so.

Then he proceeded to do lasik on my other eye then cross linking on the other.

### Did I feel any pain at any point of time?

In my opinion, the whole lasik process. I think the most uncomfortable process was the part when they were cutting the flap. But never at any point of time was it painful for me.

###Post LASIK day 0 (12 May 2014 PM)

After the procedure, I was led to a room which had a super comfy chair and some soothing music. I was then told to rest there to stabilise my flap.

After around 30 minutes, Dr Lee came to see me and was given the go ahead to go home.

My post ops instructions are as follows:

- Do not allow water to flow into your eyes
- Do not wear goggles while bathing as it'll create a suction on your eyes
- Administer eye drops as directed by the doctor
- Wear eye shields while sleeping

##Post LASIK day 1 (13 May 2014)

Went back to Dr Lee to check if my flap were in position and if they are healing. Everything was fine and healing well except for the fact that my eyes are still a little dry. He told me to increase the frequency of the lubricating eye drops to every 30 minutes.

Vision was blurry but it's also functional vision. We can carry on with daily activities already. Just that when bathing, I have to take proper care that water does not go into my eyes.

##Post LASIK day 2 (14 May 2014)

Vision is clearing up not as blurry anymore. Just that I noticed that when using computer, I will get slightly dizzy after using sometime. Guess I haven't really got used to the vision yet.

##Post LASIK Week 1

Went to see Dr Lee for the post lasik review. He said my corneas are healing great and that I will be able to sleep without my eye shields and bath without fear anymore! :)

![aww yeah](http://i.imgur.com/nRXYVpU.jpg)

##Post LASIK Week 2

Life pretty much went back to normal except for the fact that I do not have to wear specs anymore!!

##Post LASIK Month 1 (30 June 2014)

Went back for review with Dr Lee for the last time to have a final check of my eyes if they are ok.

According to Dr Lee, my eyes are doing well. Except for the fact that it's slightly dry.
I told him that I have a late night before that and he told me to put more eye drops.

He then started to explain to me that regression might occur with 2 things:

1. Poor eye habits
2. Dry eyes

That's why he told me to always put eye drops.

##Side effects I felt after lasik (As of 30 June 2014)

1. Dry eyes
2. Halos/Glares

These are the only 2 side effects I've encountered after LASIK which in my opinion the pros of lasik greatly outweighs the cons.

##Programming after lasik
Programming and writting code on the computer is not a problem after the third week of lasik, I don't feel any dizziness anymore. The only thing is that my eyes are sometimes a little dry, which I've to put some eye drops.

I also downloaded an application called [awareness](http://iamfutureproof.com/tools/awareness/) which times you on how long you have used the computer for. After 1 hour, it'll ring a bell to alert you in a non-intrusive way. After 2 hours of usage, it'll ring 2 times. I find this app pretty good and useful if you want to practice good eye habits for computer usages.

##Summing it up

Well, this sums up my lasik expirence at [Shinagawa Eye Center](http://www.shinagawa.com.sg/en).

**p.s I'll update this post if I expirence any regression/side effects in my eye sight or have problems with work.**
