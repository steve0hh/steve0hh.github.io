So yeah!

As you guys can see.. I've finally made the move to change from [wordpress](http://steve0hh.wordpress.com/) to [jekyll](http://steve0hh.github.io/) with [github pages](https://pages.github.com/)!


##Why did i do so?

I've always disliked [wordpress's](https://wordpress.com/) interface and all these while. I've been using markdown to write all my posts on wordpress. After writing all the posts, I would use [marked app's](http://markedapp.com/) "copy as html" feature to paste as text to my wordpress posts.

So I was thinking.. Well. Since I've been writing all my posts in markdown.. Why not make a switch then? :)

I found a awesome jekyll theme that I liked, ported everything over and I doubt I am ever looking back!

##So.. WELCOME!

So updates will be posted here instead of the old [wordpress](http://steve0hh.wordpress.com/) blog.
