I just sold off my [CMStorm Quickfire Pro keyboard](http://www.cmstorm.com/en/products/keyboards/quickfirepro/) and bought apple's [wireless keyboard](http://www.apple.com/sg/keyboard/) and [trackpad](http://www.apple.com/sg/magictrackpad/)!

I wanted to use the keyboard on my lap without the restrictions of the wires.
Then you ask... why buy the trackpad?


This is because I changed upon [Twelve south's MagicWand](http://twelvesouth.com/products/magicwand/). I didn't wanted to lift my hand all the way up to my table and click on something just because the software is out of focus or sometimes things are just easier done with just a simple click.


![BUT IT'S SO EXPENSIVE](http://i.imgur.com/VLAuTJl.jpg)

After much consideration, I decided **not to buy** [Twelve south's MagicWand](http://twelvesouth.com/products/magicwand/) in EpiCenter and make one myself.

Reason for not buying it:

- It's a piece of plastic
- It frigging cost approx $50SGD
- I'm not rich :)

*So below is the guide on how did i build another similar one for myself*

##How to do it then?

###Matrials needed
- Acrylic
- [Acrylic scorer/cutter](http://www.amazon.com/Plastic-Acrylic-Scorer-Cutter-Blades/dp/B007L31M3I)
- [Velcro tapes](http://www.amazon.com/Velcro-Brand-Industrial-Strength-Inches/dp/B00006IC2T)
- Pencil
- Ruler

### Skills required
- Acrylic cutting skill (Which I acquired from [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCeHx-vvJ7k))
- Basic DIY skills



###Step 1 - Mark it!
Measure about 10cm wide and approximately 38cm long and use a pencil to mark it out.

###Step 2 - Cut it out!
Using the Acrylic scorer/cutter cut and break the acrylic from the board!

###Step 2 - Align the acrylic and paste the velcro tapes
Firstly, please your wireless keyboard upside down and place the trackpad on the left of the keyboard.

*Note: Make sure you place your trackpad on your left instead of the right as once you flipped it over, the trackpad will be on the right. Unless you are left-handed*

Then, paste the velcros on the keyboard and trackpad!

Once done, place the piece of acrylic on the pasted velcro and start pasting over it.

Flip the piece of acrylic and viola!

The only thing is tht the click won't work. But tapping is good enough for me. :)

*Ps. I am writing this with the keyboard and trackpad on my lap! Pretty awesome eh? haha!*
