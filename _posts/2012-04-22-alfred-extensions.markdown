### Get Ethernet IP & copy

Get Ethernet IP & copy is a shell extension scripts that allow the user to get the current ethernet IP address. This will be helpful for network administrators or web developers trying to access their own address instead of [http://localhost](http://localhost/) due to session storage etc. The script will return an empty string to clipboard if there is no IP address for that port.

How to use:

1. Launch alfred
2. Type : `get ethernet ip` (You don't have to type everything as alfred will sort it out for you)
3. Hit enter!
4. It's as simple as that!

### Clear iMessage Archives & Attachments

After reading this [post](http://lifehacker.com/5964563/delete-your-hidden-chat-history-in-messages-and-keep-your-conversations-private) on [lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/), I've decided to make an Alfred extension to help users to clear iMessage Archives & Attachments. So if you are like me, who doesn't like to keep archives of message in your computer. Download this extension!

Note : This extension will not delete your chats in your iMessage. It'll only clear the archives stored in the computer. Useful for keeping your conversations stealthy.

How to use:

1. Launch alfred
2. Type : `clear imessage` (You don't have to type everything as alfred will sort it out for you)
3. Hit enter!
4. Done!
