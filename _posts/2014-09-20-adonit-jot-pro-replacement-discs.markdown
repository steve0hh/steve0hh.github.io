Hi guys!

Today I am gonna talk about where in Singapore can we get [replacement discs](http://store.adonit.net/products/jot-pro-replacement-discs-3-pack) for your [adonit jot pro](http://www.adonit.net/jot/pro/).

As you guys might have guess it, I lost my disc during lecture as my jot pro rolled down the table.

So I tried a few outlets in Singapore to check if they carry the [replacement discs](http://store.adonit.net/products/jot-pro-replacement-discs-3-pack) but sadly they did not.

Hence I emailed the adonit helpdesk to ask where do they sell it in Singapore.

They replied with this address:

    Nubox@Raffles City
    252, North Bridge Road,
    #03-25, Raffles Shopping Centre,
    Singapore 179103
    (Tel) 6334 8132
    Store Opening Hours:
    Mon-Sun: 10.30am to 9.30pm

Hence I went down and bought it. It's currently sold for $11 for 3 disc.

Anyway, if you are also like me, looking and googling around to check if they sell the replacement discs in Singapore, I hope I helped!
:)
