Hi guys, I'm here to announce today that I've bought the [Bosch GSK 190 Professional Circular Saw](http://www.bosch-pt.com.sg/sg/en/professional/power-tools/c131487/p21154/hand-held-circular-saws/gks-190.html) today.

This is due to the fact that other then programming, I recently got into a new hobby! WOODWORKING!

**Anyway..**

I am writing this post due to the fact that here in Singapore, I often encounter dudes working in hardware shops that can't communiate well with me. Probably I am not very good with dialect.
Also, I couldn't find much reviews online for the GSK 190, hence I am gonna write a review for it! :)

Since I bought mine online, I didn't know what to expect but I decided to take the plunge nevertheless.

## What's inside the box?

![Round up of items](http://i.imgur.com/6rf8017.jpg)

- Instruction manuals
- Circular saw with blade
- Parallel guide

I've always thought that Bosch power tools always comes with a box but for this buy, it's not included. :(

## Features

1. Variable cutting depth
2. Bevel capability of 56 degrees
3. 1400 watts

## What do I look forward in doing with this circular saw?

1) Making dadoes

And hopefully someday, when I've enough space or my own home. I'll make my own table saw.

##Update (Tuesday, 11 March, 2014)
So far so good, made several cuts using this saw and the cuts are straight and nice. :)
