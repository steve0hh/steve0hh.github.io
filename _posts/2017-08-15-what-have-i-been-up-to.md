Quick update on the latest project that I've done lately :)

## [Contester](https://github.com/steve0hh/contester)

It's basically a frontend static site written in VueJs to allow users to download likes and comments data from a facebook post, photo or video. :)

I've basically written this as a static HTML site because I would like to build a tool can be deployed at very low cost.

Luckily, [surge.sh](http://surge.sh/) allows hosting of static HTML sites for free. <3

## What did I learn from building this project

1. Basics of [VueJS](https://vuejs.org)
2. Basics of [CSVjs](https://github.com/knrz/CSV.js/)
3. Basics of [Facebook Graph API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference)

[Fork this project](https://github.com/steve0hh/contester) and contribute if you like it!

Side note: Started my internship. Busy AF.
